                At the end, family is everything, my mom was always there for me when I needed the most and my
                dad works really hard to get us a great lifestyle. But now I have a bigger problem, telling Nacho I’m
                no longer gonna talk with him. It will be so hard, I enjoy the time we pass together so much, he is
                the best person I’ve never met.

                *Calls Nacho*
                <br>-Nacho: Hey! I was thinking about you right now! This night there will be a strike on the north side
                so we can take advantage of the guards moving there to sneak out and watch the stars. The guys are
                coming too. What do you think?
                <br>-Nuria (me): Oh... yeah, that’s cool but tonight I’m gonna stay home... Sorry...
                <br>-Nacho: Are you ok? You sound like having a bad time.
                <br>-Nuria (me): Well... we need to talk. Can you come over to my bedroom tonight?
                <br>-Nacho: Sure, I’ll be there when the lights shut down.
               <br>-Nuria (me): Thanks, see you later then, love you...

                I have to think how I’m gonna tell him, I know he will underestand but I’m afraid the others wont
                accept it than easy, I know a lot about the movement and they won’t like me “deserting” even
                though I’m not one of them.

                Oh! Mum is here, I’m gonna ask her for advice, she probably knows what to do.

            <p class="text">
                Nuria (me): Hello mum!*kisses her in the cheek*
                <br>-Mum: Oh! Hello sweetie! What an incredible thing you are this affectionate.
                <br>-Nuria (me): I’ve decided you are right, I’m quitting the rebels for ever.
                <br>-Mum: Thanks god! You are making the correct choice darling, I promise it’s gonna be fine.
                <br>-Nuria (me): I hope so... but now I need your help. I don’t know how to tell Nacho...
                <br>-Mum: Who’s Nacho? IS HE DANGEROUS?!
                <br>-Nuria (me): No mum, he isn’t dangerous at all. He is a very good friend of mine. I know he will
                underestand but, the others... I don’t think it will be that easy.
                <br>-Mum: Oh dear... if he is a good person, he will underestand. You didn’t belong to that world and
                you never will. Just tell him the truth about your feelings and they have to underestand it.
                <br>-Nuria (me): Thank you mom, you are awesome!

                Nacho: Hey! I was worried about you, what happens?
                <br>-Nuria (me): Shhhh! My mom is gonna hear you!
                <br>-Nacho: Ok, ok, I’m sorry! Just tell me what you want to talk about!
                <br>-Nuria (me): Ok... I’m oficially telling you I’m quitting rebels.
                <br>-Nacho: WHAT? ARE YOU CRAZY? YOU KNOW THEY ARE NOT GONNA ACCEPT THAT!
                YOU KNOW WHERE WE ARE HIDING!
                <br>-Nuria (me): SHHHHHHHHHHH! Don’t talk that loud! I know they are going to get angry about it
                but I think it’s the best for me and my family’s future.
                <br>-Nacho: I can’t believe you are doing this to me, to us! We trusted you Nuria!
                <br>-Nuria (me): I know, I know! But I promise I will never talk about you to anybody, not even to my
                mum!
                <br>-Nacho: I know you won’t but they will not. This is going to get us in trouble...
                <br>-Nuria (me): If you could talk to them... You know me and they trust you, I won’t tell anything, I
                promise!
                <br>-Nacho: I will try, but I can’t promise. I have to go, hope we see again someday... Goodbye Nuria.
                <br>-Nuria (me): Goodbye Nacho...

                Well, that was it, I did it... Now it’s time to start again but doing things right. Tomorrow I’m getting
                up early to help mum with lunch and cleaning. Later I’m going to go out and find some job to help
                with home bills. But first, let’s go sleeping, this situation got me so tired.

                <br>-Nacho: I can’t talk for so much time. Get your mum and run away! They didn’t like you deserting
