                Although the reasons for stealing the virus sample were good, I decided to ignore him and send him to hell. I believe that stealing is not the solution, besides, if someone finds out that we are planning a robbery inside the bunker, they will probably execute us, just like they unfairly did to my father.

                As time goes by, I get the news that there is an infected person inside the bunker, they told us through the megaphones that we should remain calmed and that everything was under control. I hope that they really solved the problem. If they don´t kill the zombie, we will have a lot of problems…there are some many people here.

                I don´t know how exactly the first infected bit another person but after a week those infected in the bunker amount to 1/4 of the population. I don´t know where my group is and how they are…. I can´t stop thinking about my mother and Nacho but If I want to survive I should set aside my thoughts

                There are not many options left to me, I could hide and wait for everything to pass. Shortly after arriving at this bunker, my mother showed me a room that is a bit hidden. If I hide, I could try to hide from the infected and so, when everyone dies, I could escape. In this room I have enough food to last 5 or 6 days, I don't know if it will be enough if I hide and run out of food I would have to go out and look for more and there would be a good chance that I would get infected. The other option he would have would be to try to go out and fight the infected, try to get them out of the bunker and thus restore peace of mind. The military and civilians who are not yet infected would help me, but we will still run a great risk of becoming infected people. We should wear protective masks.

                If I make a mistake in this decision, life in the bunker could end forever. Me, my mother, my friends would die.
