                <br>-Unknown masked guy: It’s too late for that Nuria, you really messed it up.
                *They cover Nuria’s Face and wrapped their hands*
                <br>-Unknown masked guy: Now you better shut your mouth, if you even try to get away your mom will
                get in serious trouble.
                <br>-Nuria (me): No! Please! Leave her alone!

                I don’t know where are they taking me to. I’m just thinking in my mother, if they leave her there or
                she is coming with us. How can they do this to me? I helped them on everything I could.

                hanging around over here. Where’s my mum?
                <br>-Unknown masked guy: Your mom is safe, she is not a threat to us, but you are! And we can’t allow
                you to continue.
                <br>-Nuria (me): I’m not going to say anything about you! Please I still believe in you!
                <br>-Unknown masked guy: I’m so sorry, but we can’t take risks.
                *They tie Nuria to an old traffic sign*
                <br>-Nuria (me): YOU CAN’T LEAVE ME HERE! THEY ARE GONNA COME FOR ME!
