                When the infecteds appeared in the bunker, chaos started to grow. I don't exactly know how the infecteds
                entered the bunker... I don ÃÅt think that they opened the doors but now there's nothing we can do.

                The infecteds start to multiply, I could see some people who I know getting infected...It was horrible,
                I said to myself that there's nothing to do with them....but I can survive this and If I died here I
                hope that there is a second life, another one where the people won't be able to find their own
                extinction.
