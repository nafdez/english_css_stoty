                house.
                <br>-Mom: I am so grateful for what you have done, Ramón. So, it was the rebels again?
                <br>-Mom: Lately my daughter was having rebel attacks and it has me worried but I never thought of it escalating that level.
                <br>-Ramón: No worries, we all had some rebel tendencies at some point of our lifes... You know...
