                I decided to escape by the fan system. With a picklock I picked the lock, then I run to the fan system. I am lucky because the vent entrance is close to my cell.  I thought that the vent system was more difficult. All the pipes have different colors that belongs to a specific zone of the bunker, green for the canteen, blue for the crops, red for the medical zone… I know that the rebels are near to the canteen, so I must follow the green pipes.

                By the time, I´m in the canteen I feel so excited to see my boyfriend. When I arrive to entrance to the rebel zone, the people look at me vey surprise I don´t know why…. While I´m walking, I feel so heavy. I suppose that the lack of food is affecting me… I walk two steps more and I fell down.

                I wake up, in a room that is not my bedroom… I realize that I´m in the rebel zone. I sit up in bed and I see Nacho near to me… I hug him so strong; I strange him a lot.  
            </p>

                Last time later, after I ate something, I met the rest of the group.... for the first time in a long time, I feel real happiness. 
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                While I´m talking with the guys in my room, Nacho come with a man, I think that is someone important because the rest of the group leave the room. 
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                ???: Nacho told me a lot of things about you.... you remember me of your father 
                Me: Do you know my father?
                ???: Yes...he was a kindness person, he did a lot of things for the rebels
                Me: ohh really? I don´t know your name and What you want for me?
                Pablo: My name is Pablo Motos ….and I want you to join the rebels 
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                After having joined the group of rebels I have seen things that I could never imagine. The things that my mother had instilled in me and taught me are all false. I have lived in an invented world, controlled by the high officials of the state, including the army. My mother was part of the conspiracy.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                From now on I will fight for the truth to come to light and never repeat what happened in this bunker.
