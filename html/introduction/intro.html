                Some many years ago, humanity found their own extinction.A strange
                virus of unknown origin, converted the dead people into living creatures,
                the science named it, Cordyceps....The chaos born in the cities, the
                hospitals become red zones, the food in the supermarkets started to
                end...the people become more and more crazy, there are no law in the
                streets.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                The government built bunkers around the country trying to stop the
                extinction of humanity.These places become the unique lifesaver, the
                problem was that only a few people can enter these places, the military
                forces, their families and people whose job was considered
                useful(teachers, doctors, firefighters,farmers...). My family entered one
                of the bunkers due to my mother ́s position in the military.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                The bunker is divided in different levels, the upper ones there are the
                laboratory and a mini hospital, in the middle we have the canteen and
                the worker zone where we repair and create new weapons and in the
                ground levels we have the vegetable garden and the living area(women
                and men separate, and military and normal person separate too), we
                have all a person will need at this time.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                The days passed by and the people became more aggressive, and
                harder to controlate, there were so many riots. Weeks later the bunker
                was divided in two sides, the rebels and the militars.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                In my case I'm in the military because of my mother's position,but my
                father years ago decided to join the rebels, he said to me that he
                discovered something awful.... Two days later, they executed him....I
                can ́t forget his face and his shouts when two soldiers grabbed him.
                Last night, I only dreamed of this and today is no exception.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                I think that these dreams mean something, my dad discovered
                something bad about the military... he only wanted me to be safe....I ́m
                going to join the rebels
