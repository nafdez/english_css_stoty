                I need to escape, I don't think that I will survive here any more days....I have two options.

                The first one, I see a vent in the roof of the level. The bunker has a ventilation system, whose vents are all over the complex, including the rebel district... If I fit in one of them, I could probably arrive at the rebel zone.The only problem is that the network of the ventilation is so complicated, there are so many levels and districts, I will get lost so easily and get caught in the ventilation system.

                The other plan is trying to avoid the guards and get to my room to make contact with Nacho. It will be so difficult because my room is in the center of the military district.
