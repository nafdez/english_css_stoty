                – My mother made me break all contact with the rebels, but I don't want to do it because I care a lot about the guys, especially Nacho..... I am trying to sleep, but I can ́t stop thinking about the discussion I had with my mother because I have to give an answer to my mum.

                The next day, I made my choice. After having breakfast in the canteen, I went to my mother ́s office. Her office is so small, it only has a few chairs, one library and a desk, not even a single window, a really cold place.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                MOTHER- I hope you make a good choice...
                (Me) - Yes...I wanna join the rebels-
                My mom expresion was one of disappointment
                MOTHER- oh well ... I feel sorry to hear that
                Suddenly, a pair of soldiers appear next to me, grab me. I try to fight with them, but they exceed in force and number, they knock me out, I feel that someone is carrying me but I don't remember any more.....
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Suddenly I woke up, with a headache. Two seconds later I realize where I am ... the depths of the bunker, there are the cells, small rooms where militars take the people who are against the system. I don't know exactly how many times I have been here... I can ́t stop thinking about the group and especially Nacho, I hope they are fine...
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                The days pass by and I feel so bad. There is no one here with me, only my thoughts and me...
                I should escape from this if I don't want to die. In the night I hear the shouts of the people...I don ́t know why but If I stay here, I will probably die...but It's so difficult to escape from this...If they trap me, It will be my end.
