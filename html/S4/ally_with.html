                Although I had been considering leaving the faction and had a rebel boyfriend, I never imagined myself
                doing something so risky. However, Antoine believed in me and convinced me that I was the best choice
                for the task.

                Maybe he’s just using me, I thought. Anyways, as long as I don’t get caught.

                I entered the facility where the virus is stored, I encountered only two guards. A life among the
                militars has trained my stealth skills, I think this is easy, I know all their tricks. I managed to get
                into the vault where they secured the virus and escaped through the vents with a sample of it. Green and
                shiny it looks like a radioactive rod, I’m afraid of it. I gave it to Antoine and hoped for the best.

                A few days later, the military faction discovered that the virus sample was missing. During a rutinary
                investigation, they asked me if I knew anything about it. I felt my heart throb as I tried to come up
                with an explanation that doesn’t sound fake. I knew that if they found out the truth, I could be in
                serious trouble.
