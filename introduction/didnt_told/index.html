                I decided not to tell my tutor about what I dreamt. She’s the captain of the military faction, and I
                think that her reaction would be horrendous.

                Today, I’m tasked with repairing the electrical panel in the bunker. While in the electricity room, I
                met a new colleague named Antoine. He was French and seemed nervous from the start.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                We spent a lot of time having small talk but suddenly Antoine changed the subject, Antoine trusted in me
                and confessed me that he was a rebel infiltrator, but he was just an errand boy and did not want to
                cause any harm.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                I trusted him and shared with him my dream. He quickly changed the subject and told me about some
                important documents regarding a virus, or something like that. His French accent made it difficult for
                me to understand him, but I agreed to listen.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Soon, Antoine revealed that he needed me to steal a virus sample from the military faction.
